README TEXT ADVENTURE

In this text adventure you're supposed to be the Grim Reaper.
The objective of the game is to collect a certain amount of souls.
When inputing your arguments make sure you use a dash "-" between the locations that have more than two words.
In order to go places, just type go and the destination.
There is also certain items in certain locations where some items you must get them by opening chests or killing enemies.
There are a few errors. When trying to get that when my ArrayList contains certain objects it won't compile correctly.
Also there are some errors when trying to take a few objects.
Other than that it should wor fine. I'll release a patch later on :).
